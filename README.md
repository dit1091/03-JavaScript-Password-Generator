# 03-JavaScript-Password-Generator

Created an application that generates a random password base on user-selected criteria using html, css, and javascript.
The user is first prompted to click a button which catalyzes a series of confirmation alerts. Once the user successfully responds to the confirmation alerts and requests a password length between 8 and 128 characters then the application spits back a random passwords that satisfy the the userâ€™s criteria.
